You will need to do these 2 operations:
- Update your DNS config according the suggested config for the domain "__DOMAIN__". In most of case it will consist of adding a `CNAME` for `sandbox.__DOMAIN__` to `__DOMAIN__`. You can see the suggested configuration with this following command:
```
yunohost domain dns suggest __DOMAIN__
```
Please, be sure the CNAME is correctly added on your dns zone and wait for the DNS propagation

- After that you will need to (force) renew your (let's encrypt) certificate. This is needed to add as "alternative domain" the domain `sandbox.__DOMAIN__` in your certificate. To do this you can do it from the webadmin in "Domains" > "__DOMAIN__" > "Certificate" > "Renew Let's Encrypt certificate" or from this following command:
```
yunohost domain cert renew __DOMAIN__ --force
```
